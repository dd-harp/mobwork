## $\odot$  

The SIS model, as it is now called, is a simple compartmental model, first introduced by Ross. It is included in `exDE` as a base model. 

The model defined herein is defined in two parts. To model exposure and infection (*i.e.* the conversion of eir into foi), we assume that the fraction of infective bites that cause an infection is $b$. The dynamics are given by: 

$$
\frac{dX}{dt} = h (H-X)-rX
$$

True prevalence is:

$$x = \frac{X}{H}.$$ 

In our implementation, net infectiousness is linearly proportional to prevalence:

$$c x.$$
In this implementation, there is no immunity, but we assume a constant fraction of all infectious bites cause an infection. 

**Parameters**

+ $r$ is the rate infections clear

+ $b$ is the fraction of bites by infective mosquitoes that transmit parasites and cause an infection. 

+ $c$ is the fraction of bites on an infectious human that would infect a mosquito.
